This is a test business strategy document about network effects and strategic planning. Network effects occur when a product becomes more valuable as more people use it. This creates a competitive moat that's difficult for competitors to overcome. Strategic planning involves setting long-term goals and determining the best approach to achieve them. Companies that master network effects often become dominant in their markets. The key is to build products that get better with more users, creating a flywheel effect that accelerates growth.
